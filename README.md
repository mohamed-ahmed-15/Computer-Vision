# Computer-Vision

# What is Computer Vision?
- Computer vision is a field of computer science that teaches computers to understand and interpret images and videos, much like how humans do.
- It allows computers to identify objects, faces, or even actions in visual content by analyzing patterns and features.
- For example, itâ€™s used in applications like face recognition on phones, self-driving cars to detect obstacles, or medical scans to help diagnose diseases.

#  Using Computer Vision?
Detecting faces allows the devices to identify the presence of faces apart from the task of recognizing them.

# How it works:
- Face Detection: The system first identifies and locates the face within an image or video using algorithms like Haar cascades or deep learning models.
- Landmark Detection: Once the face is detected, key facial landmarks (like the eyes, mouth, nose, and eyebrows) are identified to track facial movements.
- Feature Extraction: The system then extracts features, such as changes in the shape of the mouth or the squinting of eyes, which are associated with different expressions.
- Classification: Based on the extracted features, the system uses machine learning models (like deep neural networks) to classify the faces being displayed by the person
